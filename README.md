# Space Invaders
A game built with PyGame and following along an FCC tutorial.

## What it is
So, in my journey of learning and trying out PyGame, I followed along a tutorial that created a Space Invaders game like this. I haven't been able to find the original tutorial, if you have it, please let me know and I will add it to this description.

The game itself is very simple. You shoot aliens with your spaceship. The game keeps track of score, of course. And if an alien gets low enough, you lose. Game Over. Although simple, it is quite addictive, I must say.

Here are some images:
